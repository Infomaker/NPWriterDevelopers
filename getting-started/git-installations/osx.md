# {{ page.title }}

**OS X comes pre-bundled with Git. You may stop reading here if you want**.  

## Using an installer package
Download the installer package from the [Git SCM site](https://git-scm.com/download/mac). 

After the installation finishes, please close and re-open Terminal to allow environment variable changes to kick in.

## Using Homebrew

If you are using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) on OS X, you may install Git by issuing:

    $ brew install git 

After the installation finishes, please close and re-open Terminal to allow environment variable changes to kick in.

## Test the installation

Open up the Terminal and type:

    $ git --version
      git version 2.10.2
